# The Memecoin Stress Test: Solana vs Aptos

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Network comparison or fee visualization

## Hook

*"March 2024. Solana memecoin season."*

*"The network didn't crash. It just became unusable for anyone who couldn't afford premium gas."*

*"Aptos? Sixty milliseconds. Flat fees. Business as usual."*

---

## Script

*"Transaction volume exploded. Priority fees spiked to insane levels. Regular users couldn't send basic transfers."*

**[Explain the mechanism]**

*"Why? Solana's fee market is an auction. When demand exceeds capacity, prices rise until demand drops. Economics 101."*

*"But it means regular users get priced out during exactly the moments they want to participate."*

**[Show Aptos approach]**

*"Aptos takes a completely different approach."*

*"No priority auction. Transactions order by arrival, not by fee. You can't buy your way to the front."*

*"Higher base throughput. Block-STM's parallel execution means 2-3x more capacity for the same hardware."*

**[Point to current performance]**

*"And look at the block times. Sixty to a hundred milliseconds with Velociraptr. Blocks keep landing regardless of demand."*

*"When a memecoin goes viral on Aptos, more transactions process—but per-transaction cost stays flat."*

*"Retail users need predictable costs. They need to know their $50 trade won't cost $200 in gas because some whale is moving millions."*

## Banger

*"Memecoins go viral. Fees stay flat. Sixty milliseconds. Every block. Every user."*

---

## Key Points
- Solana memecoin season: fees spiked, users priced out
- Fee auctions = regular users excluded at peak demand
- Aptos: No priority auction, arrival-based ordering
- Block-STM: 2-3x higher capacity
- ~60-100ms blocks maintained during viral events
