# Leader Reputation: Shoal++

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Leader reputation visualization

---

## Hook

*"Naive consensus gives every validator equal leader turns. But some are slow. Some have bad connections. Every failed proposal wastes a round."*

*"Shoal++ fixes this with reputation."*

---

## Script

**[Point to validator scores]**

*"Two metrics: Did your proposals succeed when you were leader? Did you vote on time when others were leader?"*

*"Good performance? Score rises. More leader slots."*

*"Poor performance? Fewer chances to slow everyone down."*

**[Show the distribution]**

*"The math is probabilistic—not deterministic. No validator gets completely excluded. But reliable validators propose 3x more often than unreliable ones."*

**[Show the impact]**

*"60% fewer failed rounds. Consensus moves faster because we stopped asking slow validators to lead."*

## Banger

*"Reputation rewards. Reliability reigns."*

## Key Points
- Reputation-weighted probabilistic leader selection
- Tracks proposal success and vote participation
- Reliable validators get 3x more leader slots
- 60% reduction in failed consensus rounds
- Network automatically routes around poor performers
