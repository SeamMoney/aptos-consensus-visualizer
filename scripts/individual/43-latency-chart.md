# Latency Chart: The Only Metric Users Actually Feel

**Duration:** ~45-60 seconds  
**Animation:** Rolling latency chart (Grafana-style)
**Status:** 🟢 LIVE

---

## Hook

*"TPS is impressive. But latency is what users feel."*

---

## Script

**[Show the latency chart trending over time]**

*"This chart is end-to-end block latency — how long it takes a transaction to reach finality."*

*"Each spike is a real moment on-chain: sudden traffic, a burst of blocks, or a transient network hiccup."*

**[Point to the steady baseline]**

*"Notice the baseline. That's the key. The line stays tight, even as load fluctuates."*

*"Aptos keeps finality sub-second because consensus is only four hops and execution runs in parallel."*

**[Highlight stability]**

*"If latency stays flat while throughput climbs, you get the holy grail: faster without getting sloppy."*

---

## Banger

*"Speed is a headline. Latency is the lived experience."*

---

## Key Points
- End-to-end finality, not just block production
- Tight latency band under variable load
- Parallel execution keeps tail latency low
- Sub-second finality that feels instant to users
