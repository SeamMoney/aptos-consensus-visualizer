| Fee Comparison | *"Same spike. Same demand. Solana: hundred thousand X fees. Aptos: flat line."* |
| Fee Stress Test | *"TPS to the moon. Fees to the floor. That's not a bug—that's the architecture."* |
| Encrypted Mempool | *"They can't front-run what they can't see. Encrypted mempool. MEV ends here."* |

## The Core Numbers to Remember

| Metric | Current (Velociraptr) | Future (Archon) |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Block Time | ~60-100ms | Sub-10ms |
| Finality | ~300-500ms | ~50ms |
| TPS Capacity | 160,000 | 1,000,000+ |

## Alliterations for Memory

Use these for emphasis and recall:

| Feature | Alliteration |
|---------|-------------|
| Block-STM | "Parallel processing, peak performance" |
| Raptr | "Four hops, forever final" |
| Velociraptr | "Propose with precision, perform with speed" |
| Quorum Store | "Decoupled data, dominating delivery" |
| Loader V2 | "Cache once, crush constantly" |
| Zaptos | "Pipeline power, perpetual processing" |
| Archon | "Local latency, global guarantee" |
| Shardines | "Scale seamlessly, shard smartly" |
| Fees | "Stable, steady, sixty milliseconds" |
| Finality | "Fast, final, forever" |
| Consensus | "Coordinated, cryptographic, certain" |
| Speed | "Sixty milliseconds, same gas, scaling" |
| **NEW FEATURES** | |
| Transaction Shuffling | "Shuffled, secure, surprising" |
| Orderless Txns | "Nonces not numbers, parallel not queued" |
| X-Chain Accounts | "One key, every chain, zero bridges" |
| Keyless Accounts | "Sign in, stay secure, skip the seed phrase" |
| Move Aggregators | "Million mints, minimal time" |
| Encrypted Mempool | "Hidden until executed, harmed by none" |

## Transition Phrases

For moving between sections:

- *"But here's the thing..."*
- *"Watch this..."*
- *"Now here's where it gets interesting..."*
- *"Let's break it down..."*
- *"Here's what actually happens..."*
- *"The insight is simple..."*
- *"Most chains do X. Aptos does Y."*
- *"Look at the numbers..."*

---

## Contrast Patterns

For competitive comparisons:

- *"[Competitor] does X. Aptos does Y."*
- *"On slow chains: [problem]. On Aptos: sixty milliseconds."*
- *"The old way: [sequential]. The Aptos way: [parallel]."*
- *"Other chains optimize for average. Aptos optimizes for spike."*
- *"Solana: fees spike. Sui: objects bottleneck. Aptos: sixty milliseconds, flat fees."*

---

## The "Sixty Milliseconds" Cadence

When you say "sixty milliseconds," always let it land. Options:

- *"Sixty milliseconds. Every block."*
- *"Sixty milliseconds. Same gas."*
- *"Sixty milliseconds. No exceptions."*
- *"Sixty milliseconds. That's Aptos."*
- *"Sixty milliseconds. Final."*

## Script Delivery Tips

**Pacing:**
- Start punchy—hook in 3 seconds
- Slow down for "sixty milliseconds"—let it register
- Speed up through technical details
- Punch the banger line

**Pointing:**
- Point at the block time stat when you say the number
- Circle the TPS counter
- Trace the transaction flow with your cursor

**Energy:**
- Higher energy for comparisons ("Solana does THIS, Aptos does THIS")
- Calm confidence for technical deep dives
- Build intensity toward the banger
- Drop to steady and certain for "sixty milliseconds"

**Cadence for Bangers:**
- Pause before the line
- Deliver slowly and deliberately
- Let it land before moving on
- "Sixty" gets slightly more emphasis than "milliseconds"
