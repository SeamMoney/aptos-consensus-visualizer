# Liquidation Cascades: When Milliseconds Mean Millions

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Transaction pipeline or high-activity visualization

## Hook

*"Black Thursday. March 2020. MakerDAO liquidations failed because Ethereum couldn't process fast enough."*

*"Bots bid ZERO dollars for collateral—and won. Eight million dollars gone."*

*"On Aptos? Sixty millisecond blocks. Every liquidation lands."*

---

## Script

*"Liquidations are time-critical AND high-volume. When prices crash, thousands of positions go underwater simultaneously. Every liquidator races to claim them."*

**[Show what happens on slow chains]**

*"On slow chains: Network clogs. Transactions fail. Undercollateralized positions stay open. Bad debt accumulates. Protocols collapse."*

*"On fee-auction chains: Rich bots outbid everyone. Small liquidators can't compete. Centralization wins."*

**[Show Aptos handling it]**

*"On Aptos, here's what happens:"*

*"Sixty millisecond blocks. Liquidators know immediately if they won. No guessing, no resubmission, no gas wars."*

*"Block-STM parallel execution. Multiple liquidations process simultaneously—different positions don't block each other."*

*"Stable fees. Small liquidators can compete. You don't need a massive gas budget to participate."*

**[Show the healthy market result]**

*"More liquidators. Faster execution. Healthier markets. DeFi that actually works during volatility."*

## Banger

*"Markets crash. Aptos clears. Sixty milliseconds. Every liquidation. Every time."*

## Key Points
- Black Thursday: $8M lost due to network congestion
- Liquidations: Time-critical + high-volume simultaneously
- Aptos: ~60ms blocks, immediate confirmation
- Parallel execution: Positions don't block each other
- Stable fees: Small liquidators can compete
