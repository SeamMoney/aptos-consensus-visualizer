# Block River: Live Network Pulse

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Block River live visualization

---

## Hook

*"This is the heartbeat of Aptos. Live blocks. Real-time. Right now."*

---

## Script

**[Point to the grid]**

*"Each cell is a block. Brighter green means more transactions packed inside. Watch the rhythm."*

*"See the block time stat? Sixty to a hundred milliseconds. That's Velociraptr consensus—optimistic proposals landing faster than you can blink."*

**[Show the stats updating]**

*"Block height climbing. TPS fluctuating with demand. This isn't a simulation. This is mainnet, live, as it happens."*

*"When you see a burst of bright blocks, that's activity—real transactions, real value moving on Aptos."*

**[Watch the flow]**

*"The network adapts. High demand? Blocks fill up. Low demand? They stay light."*

*"But block time? Stays steady. Sixty milliseconds. No congestion pricing. No degradation. Just consistent, relentless blocks."*

## Banger

*"Every block a heartbeat. Sixty milliseconds. Every transaction alive."*

## Key Points
- Real-time block production visualization
- Color intensity = transaction density
- ~60-100ms block times (Velociraptr)
- Live metrics: block height, TPS, block time
- Consistent timing regardless of load
