# The Super Bowl Moment: Designing for Peak Load

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Block River during high activity

---

## Hook

*"Engineers call it the Super Bowl Moment. When your entire year's peak traffic hits in one hour."*

*"Most chains optimize for Tuesday. Aptos optimizes for the Super Bowl."*

---

## Script

*"For prediction markets, it's election night. For NFTs, it's a hyped mint. For DeFi, it's a market crash. For gaming, it's a tournament final."*

*"Most blockchain architectures work fine normally. Then crumble when it matters."*

**[Show architecture handling spike]**

*"Aptos is designed for the spike."*

*"Quorum Store continuously pre-stages transactions. When the flood comes, validators aren't scrambling to share data—they already have it."*

*"Block-STM has massive headroom. Normal days? Maybe 20% of theoretical capacity. Spike days? Room to breathe."*

**[Point to current metrics]**

*"And look at the block times. Sixty to a hundred milliseconds. Velociraptr keeping pace regardless of load."*

*"No fee auctions means no death spiral. High demand doesn't trigger higher fees, which trigger more competition, which trigger even higher fees."*

**[Show stable performance]**

*"The architecture assumes spikes are normal. Because for real applications, they are."*

*"With Archon coming? Sub-10 millisecond blocks during the spike. That's not just keeping up—that's dominating."*

## Banger

*"Every chain works on quiet Tuesdays. Aptos delivers sixty milliseconds on Super Bowl Sunday."*

## Key Points
- Super Bowl Moment: Year's peak traffic in one hour
- Most chains optimize for average, fail at peak
- Current: ~60-100ms blocks under load (Velociraptr)
- 80% headroom on normal days
- Future: Archon for sub-10ms during spikes
