# Aptos for HFT: Speed + Fairness + MEV Protection

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Speed + ordering + protection flow
**Status:** 🔵 COMPOSITE (Live + Coming Features)

---

## Hook

*"High-frequency trading needs three things: Speed. Deterministic ordering. Protection from extraction."*

*"Aptos delivers all three. Here's the stack."*

---

## Script

**[Speed Layer]**

*"Speed first. Sixty millisecond blocks today with Velociraptr. Already 200x faster than Ethereum."*

*"Coming 2026: Archon consensus. Sub-10 millisecond blocks. 30ms confirmation. CEX-level latency with full decentralization."*

*"True BFT finality—not probabilistic. When your trade confirms, it's done. No reorg risk."*

**[Ordering Layer]**

*"Ordering second. On most chains, highest gas bidder wins. Rich bots front-run everyone."*

*"Aptos uses arrival-based ordering. First come, first served. No priority auction."*

*"Transaction shuffling adds unpredictability. Even if someone sees the mempool, they can't predict final position."*

*"Orderless transactions remove sequence bottlenecks. Multiple trades from your account execute in parallel."*

**[Protection Layer]**

*"Protection third. Encrypted mempool hides your trade intent. Bots can't see what you're doing until execution is guaranteed."*

*"Confidential transactions hide your position sizes. Nobody knows you're the whale."*

*"No sandwich attacks. No information leakage. Your strategy stays yours."*

**[Execution Layer]**

*"Execution fourth. Block-STM processes trades in parallel. Your order doesn't wait for unrelated transactions."*

*"Stable fees mean no gas wars. Same cost at peak volume as idle."*

**[The Edge]**

*"Your competitive edge comes from speed and strategy. Not from having the biggest gas budget. Not from paying for order flow."*

## Banger

*"Ten milliseconds. Fair ordering. Zero extraction. HFT that rewards skill, not spending."*
