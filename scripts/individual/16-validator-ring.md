# Validator Ring: Decentralization Visualized

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Validator ring animation

---

## Hook

*"Who actually secures Aptos? Not promises in a whitepaper. Real validators. Right here."*

---

## Script

**[Point to the ring]**

*"Each node is a validator. Size shows voting power—more stake, more influence. The highlighted one? Current proposer for this round."*

*"Watch it rotate. Different leaders every round. No single point of control."*

**[Show participation status]**

*"Green means voted successfully. Red means missed. Consensus requires two-thirds of voting power to finalize."*

**[Show distribution]**

*"Look at the spread. No single validator dominates. The largest has maybe 3-4% of stake. You'd need to compromise dozens of independent operators to attack the network."*

*"Different validators. Different operators. Different geographies. All agreeing on every block."*

---

## Banger

*"Decentralization you can see. Democracy you can verify."*
