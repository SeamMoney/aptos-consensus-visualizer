# Polymarket on Aptos: The Technical Case

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** TPS race + Block River

---

## Hook

*"Polymarket processes more volume than most stock exchanges. On infrastructure that wasn't built for it."*

*"Imagine what they could do on a chain that was."*

---

## Script

*"The problem: Polygon's throughput is fine for normal days. But prediction markets don't HAVE normal days."*

*"They have election nights. Verdict announcements. Breaking news. Demand spikes aren't bugs—they're the product."*

**[Show Aptos metrics]**

*"Here's what Aptos offers right now. Today. Not theoretical."*

*"Sixty to a hundred millisecond blocks. That's Velociraptr consensus—optimistic proposals, pipelined execution."*

*"160,000 TPS capacity. That's every Polymarket user trading simultaneously with room to spare."*

**[Point to fee stability]**

*"Sub-second finality. Your bet confirms before the news cycle moves on. No 'pending' anxiety."*

*"Stable gas fees. When everyone rushes to trade the verdict, gas doesn't spike. The whale and the retail trader pay identical fees."*

**[Point to Block-STM]**

*"Parallel orderbook execution. Block-STM treats each price level independently. Market buys don't block limit sells."*

*"And with Archon on the horizon? Sub-10 millisecond blocks. That's faster than most centralized exchanges."*

## Banger

*"Sixty milliseconds. Stable fees. Unlimited scale. Polymarket deserves infrastructure that doesn't flinch."*

---

## Key Points
- Current: ~60-100ms blocks (Velociraptr)
- 160K TPS demonstrated capacity
- Sub-second finality for fast-moving events
- Stable fees regardless of demand
- Future: Archon for sub-10ms blocks
