# High-Frequency Trading: Sub-100ms Blocks Today, Sub-10ms Tomorrow

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Latency chart + Archon visualization

## Hook

*"High-frequency trading on blockchain sounds impossible. Traditional HFT operates in microseconds. Blockchains? Seconds."*

*"Aptos is closing that gap. Fast."*

---

## Script

**[Point to current block times]**

*"Right now, mainnet. Sixty to a hundred millisecond blocks. That's Velociraptr—optimistic proposals where leaders don't wait for the previous block to fully confirm before proposing the next."*

*"That's already 200x faster than Ethereum's 12 seconds."*

**[Show finality]**

*"But speed means nothing without finality. Aptos gives you true BFT finality—not probabilistic. When your trade confirms, it's done. No reorg risk. No waiting for more blocks. Final."*

**[Point to Archon visualization]**

*"And this is where it's going. Archon consensus. Co-located validators in the same data center reaching agreement in 5 milliseconds internally, then broadcasting globally."*

*"Sub-10 millisecond blocks. That's approaching traditional finance latency."*

**[Highlight the ordering mechanism]**

*"But here's what really matters for HFT: deterministic ordering. No priority fees means no front-running through wallet size. Transactions order by arrival."*

*"Your edge comes from speed and strategy—not from being the richest bot."*

## Banger

*"Sixty milliseconds today. Ten milliseconds tomorrow. First in, first executed. Speed wins—not spending."*

## Key Points
- Current: ~60-100ms blocks (Velociraptr)
- 200x faster than Ethereum
- True BFT finality, not probabilistic
- Future: Archon for sub-10ms co-located consensus
- Deterministic ordering by arrival time
