# Block Stream: The Chain’s Heartbeat

**Duration:** ~45-60 seconds  
**Animation:** Live block stream with height + transaction counts
**Status:** 🟢 LIVE

---

## Hook

*"If you want to feel a blockchain, watch the blocks move."*

---

## Script

**[Show blocks flowing across the screen]**

*"Each block is a heartbeat. Height ticks up, transactions get sealed, and the chain moves forward."*

*"The speed here isn’t simulated. This is the live chain producing blocks in real time."*

**[Point to transaction counts]**

*"More transactions per block means the network is absorbing demand without slowing down."*

*"When throughput rises, the cadence stays steady. That’s the signature of parallel execution."*

---

## Banger

*"TPS is a number. Blocks are the rhythm."*

---

## Key Points
- Live block production at real network speed
- Transaction counts reflect real demand
- Stable cadence under load shows true throughput
