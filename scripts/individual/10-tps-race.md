# TPS Race: Why Aptos Leads

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** TPS race comparison

## Hook

*"Everyone claims high TPS. Aptos: 160K. Sui: 120K. Solana: 65K."*

*"But the numbers mean nothing without the architecture."*

---

## Script

**[Point to each chain's approach]**

*"Solana uses Sealevel. Parallel execution—but you must pre-declare what data you'll touch. Guess wrong? Transaction fails. Works for simple transfers, struggles with complex DeFi."*

*"Sui uses object-centric execution. Fast for single-owner objects. But shared objects? They bottleneck."*

*"Aptos uses Block-STM. Execute optimistically. Detect conflicts automatically. Re-execute only what's necessary."*

**[Highlight the key difference]**

*"No pre-declaration. No object limitations. Works on ANY transaction type. 8-16x speedup."*

*"The difference is flexibility. Block-STM handles whatever you throw at it—DEX swaps, NFT mints, complex contracts—all at maximum parallelism."*

## Banger

*"Raw TPS is marketing. Execution architecture is engineering. Aptos chose both."*

## Key Points
- Solana Sealevel: Pre-declared dependencies, fails on wrong guesses
- Sui: Object-centric, bottlenecks on shared objects
- Aptos Block-STM: Optimistic execution, automatic conflict detection
- Block-STM works on any transaction pattern
