# Consensus Evolution: Mysticeti vs Archon

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Mysticeti vs Archon comparison

## Hook

*"Aptos research isn't betting on one future. They're building two."*

---

## Script

**[Point to Mysticeti side]**

*"Mysticeti v2: DAG-based consensus. Multiple validators propose blocks in parallel. Each block references others, forming a directed acyclic graph."*

*"The advantage: No single leader bottleneck. Multiple proposals per round. Maximum decentralization."*

**[Point to Archon side]**

*"Archon: Cluster-based consensus. Co-located validators reach agreement in microseconds internally, then broadcast globally."*

*"The advantage: Network topology optimization. Sub-10ms blocks within clusters."*

**[Show both architectures]**

*"Different optimization targets. Mysticeti maximizes decentralization. Archon minimizes latency."*

*"Both achieve Byzantine fault tolerance. The future might combine both—parallel proposals within ultra-fast clusters."*

## Banger

*"Two frontiers. One goal. Consensus perfected."*

---

## Key Points
- Mysticeti v2: DAG-based, parallel proposals, no leader bottleneck
- Archon: Cluster-based, sub-10ms internal consensus
- Both maintain Byzantine fault tolerance
- Research exploring multiple optimization paths
