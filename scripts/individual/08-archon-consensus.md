# Archon: Sub-10ms Consensus

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Archon cluster visualization

## Hook

*"Physics is the enemy. Light takes 70 milliseconds to cross the Atlantic. You can't beat physics."*

*"But you can work around it."*

---

## Script

**[Point to the internal cluster]**

*"Five validators. Same data center. Network latency between them? Sub-millisecond."*

*"They run PBFT internally. Propose, prepare, commit—all within the cluster. Five milliseconds total."*

*"THEN they broadcast globally."*

**[Show the timing comparison]**

*"The cluster achieves consensus before packets even reach validators across the ocean."*

*"Sub-10 millisecond blocks. Real-time applications. Finally possible."*

---

## Banger

*"Local consensus, global broadcast. Latency obliterated."*

---

## Key Points
- Co-located validator clusters (same data center)
- Internal PBFT consensus in ~5ms
- Results broadcast to external validators
- Sub-10ms block times within cluster
- Full Byzantine fault tolerance maintained
