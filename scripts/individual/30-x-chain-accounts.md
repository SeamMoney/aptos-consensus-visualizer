**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Cross-chain wallet derivation flow
**Status:** 🟠 LIVE ON DEVNET (Mainnet Soon)

## Hook

*"You have a MetaMask wallet. You have a Phantom wallet. You don't want another seed phrase."*

*"X-Chain Accounts: Use your existing wallet on Aptos. No bridge. No new keys."*

---

## Script

**[Show ETH/SOL wallets]**

*"Here's the problem. Every new chain means a new wallet. New seed phrase. New security risk. New friction."*

*"Users don't want 47 wallets. They want one identity that works everywhere."*

**[Show the derivation flow]**

*"X-Chain Accounts solve this. Your Ethereum key or Solana key can control an Aptos account directly."*

*"How it works: You sign in with MetaMask or Phantom at an Aptos dApp. The signature proves you own that key."*

*"From that key plus the dApp's domain, we derive a unique Aptos account address. Cryptographically. Deterministically."*

**[Show the account being used]**

*"No bridge needed. No wrapped assets. Your ETH wallet IS your Aptos wallet for that dApp."*

*"The account is scoped to the domain—security isolation built in. Different dApps, different derived accounts, same master key."*

**[Show onboarding]**

*"Onboarding? Instant. Solana user clicks connect, signs once, has an Aptos account. Done."*

## Banger

*"One wallet. Every chain. No bridges. No new seeds. X-Chain unlocks Aptos for everyone."*

## Key Points
- AIP-113 (Derivable Account Abstraction), AIP-121 (Solana), AIP-122 (Ethereum)
- Live on devnet, mainnet coming soon
- MetaMask and Phantom support
- Account derived from: external key + dApp domain
- No bridging required
- dApp-scoped accounts for security isolation
- Gas sponsorship recommended (X-chain accounts may lack APT initially)
