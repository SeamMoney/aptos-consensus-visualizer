## Hook

*"March 2024. Memecoin mania. Let's watch what happened to fees on Solana versus Aptos."*

*"Same demand spike. Wildly different outcomes."*

---

## Script

**[Show split-screen: Solana on left, Aptos on right]**

*"Left side: Solana. Transaction volume explodes. Watch the fee chart."*

**[Solana fees spike dramatically]**

*"Priority fees go vertical. 0.000005 SOL to 0.5 SOL. That's a hundred thousand X increase."*

*"Regular users priced out instantly. Can't afford to move their own tokens. Network works—but only for whales."*

**[Show Aptos side staying flat]**

*"Right side: Aptos. Same time period. Similar transaction surge."*

*"Fee chart? Flat line. Same price as yesterday. Same price as tomorrow."*

**[Explain the difference]**

*"Why? Solana uses fee auctions. High demand triggers bidding wars. Highest payer wins. Everyone else waits or overpays."*

*"Aptos? No auction. Governance sets the fee. Transactions order by arrival, not by bid."*

**[Show throughput comparison]**

*"When demand spikes, Solana raises prices. Aptos raises throughput."*

*"Block-STM processes more transactions per block. The response to demand is capacity, not extraction."*

## Banger

*"Same spike. Same demand. Solana: hundred thousand X fees. Aptos: flat line. Architecture matters."*
