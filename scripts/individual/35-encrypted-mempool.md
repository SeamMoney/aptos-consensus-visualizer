# Encrypted Mempool: The End of Front-Running

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Ciphertext flow → batch decryption → execution
**Status:** 🔵 COMING SOON (Pending Governance Vote)

## Hook

*"Every transaction you send is visible in the mempool. Bots see it. They front-run you. They sandwich you. They extract your value."*

*"What if they couldn't see it at all?"*

---

## Script

**[Show traditional mempool exposure]**

*"Here's how MEV works today. You submit a trade. It enters the mempool, visible to everyone. Bots analyze it. They see you're buying Token X."*

*"Lightning fast, they buy before you, push the price up, let your trade execute at a worse price, then sell into your purchase."*

*"Sandwich complete. They profit. You lose."*

**[Show encrypted transaction flow]**

*"Encrypted Mempool changes everything. Your transaction enters the mempool as encrypted ciphertext. Validators can't read it. Bots can't analyze it."*

*"The content is hidden until execution is guaranteed."*

**[Show batch threshold decryption]**

*"When it's time to execute, validators collectively decrypt the entire batch. Novel batched threshold encryption—one operation reveals everything simultaneously."*

*"6-8 milliseconds to encrypt per transaction. Minimal impact on latency."*

**[Show protection benefits]**

*"Front-running? Impossible—they can't see what you're trading."*

*"Sandwich attacks? Gone—your intent is hidden."*

*"Order flow manipulation? Eliminated—strategies stay confidential."*

*"This is the first L1 with native encrypted mempool. Not a sidecar. Not a wrapper. Built into the protocol."*

## Banger

*"They can't front-run what they can't see. Encrypted mempool. Native to Aptos. MEV ends here."*

## Key Points
- First L1 with native encrypted mempool
- Pending governance approval (announced October 2025)
- 6-8ms encryption per transaction
- Batched threshold decryption by validators
- Prevents: front-running, sandwich attacks, order flow manipulation
- Transaction intent hidden until execution guaranteed
- No latency impact due to validator pipelining
