# Zaptos: Pipelined Consensus + Execution

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Zaptos pipeline Gantt chart

---

## Hook

*"Traditional blockchains finish one block before starting the next. Propose, vote, execute, commit. Then repeat."*

*"Zaptos pipelines everything."*

---

## Script

**[Point to blocks at different stages]**

*"Look—four blocks in flight simultaneously. Block N commits to disk. N+1 certifies. N+2 executes. N+3 reaches consensus."*

*"Each stage runs on different hardware. CPUs execute while disks write while validators vote."*

*"No idle hardware. No wasted cycles. No waiting."*

**[Show the throughput]**

*"Same validators. 4x the utilization."*

---

## Banger

*"Pipeline parallelism. Peak performance. Pure throughput."*

---

## Key Points
- 4 stages running concurrently: Consensus, Execution, Certify, Storage
- Multiple blocks in flight simultaneously
- Hardware fully utilized—no idle components
- Same validator set, dramatically higher throughput
