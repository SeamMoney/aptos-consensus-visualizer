## Hook

*"What if 'Sign in with Google' WAS your private key? No seed phrase. No wallet download. Just... sign in."*

*"That's Keyless Accounts. And it's live on Aptos today."*

## Script

**[Show traditional wallet onboarding]**

*"Here's why crypto onboarding fails. Download a wallet. Write down 24 words. Store them safely. Don't lose them or your money's gone forever."*

*"We're asking grandma to be her own bank. No wonder adoption stalls."*

**[Show keyless flow]**

*"Keyless Accounts flip the script. User clicks 'Sign in with Google.' Authenticates with their existing account. Done."*

*"Behind the scenes: Your Google identity plus the dApp creates a deterministic blockchain address. Zero-knowledge proofs verify you without exposing your email to validators."*

**[Show the account being used]**

*"The result? A real Aptos account. Holds assets. Signs transactions. Full functionality."*

*"But the user never saw a seed phrase. Never downloaded a wallet. Never left the dApp."*

**[Show supported providers]**

*"Google. Apple. Any OIDC provider through federated keyless. The Web2 login they already know becomes their Web3 identity."*

**[Note about recovery]**

*"Best practice: Add a backup key for recovery. Creates a 1-of-2 multisig—social login OR traditional key."*

## Banger
