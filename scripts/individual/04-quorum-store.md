# Quorum Store: Decoupled Data Availability

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Quorum Store flow animation

## Hook

*"Here's a bottleneck nobody talks about. Most chains couple data and consensus. Leaders collect transactions, build blocks, AND get agreement. All sequential. All slow."*

*"Quorum Store decouples everything."*

---

## Script

**[Walk through the stages]**

*"Transactions arrive. Validators batch them immediately—no waiting."*

*"Batches disseminate in parallel. Everyone starts sharing before consensus even begins."*

*"Two-thirds have it? Proof of Store. Data's available network-wide."*

*"Now consensus? It just orders pre-certified batches. Leaders can't bottleneck because data is already everywhere."*

**[Show batches flowing]**

## Banger

*"Data disseminates. Consensus coordinates. Decoupled domination."*

---

## Key Points
- Based on Narwhal protocol
- Data availability decoupled from ordering
- Proof of Store requires 2/3 validators
- Leaders sequence pre-certified data, not raw transactions
