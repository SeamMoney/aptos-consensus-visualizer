# Why Fees Spike (And Why Aptos Fees Don't)

## Hook

*"Ethereum fees hit $200. Solana fees spiked 100,000%."*

*"Aptos fees are the same today as they were last month. And last year."*

*"Here's why."*

---

## Script

*"Fee spikes aren't random. They're the predictable result of auction-based markets."*

*"Demand exceeds capacity. Users bid higher. Validators take the richest transactions. Prices rise until demand drops."*

*"Economically elegant. Practically brutal. Peak demand—exactly when you need the network—it becomes unaffordable."*

**[Show Aptos model]**

*"Aptos chose differently."*

*"No auction. Transactions order by arrival time. Fee is flat, set by governance—not real-time panic."*

*"When demand spikes, the response isn't higher prices. It's higher throughput."*

**[Point to performance]**

*"Block-STM processes more transactions per block. Velociraptr keeps blocks landing every sixty milliseconds. Validators work harder, not more expensively."*

**[Address the objection]**

*"But doesn't flat fees cause spam? No. The fee is set high enough to prevent attacks, low enough to be accessible."*

*"Validators earn through volume, not extraction. Ten million transactions at fair price beats ten thousand at exploitative price."*

## Banger

*"Auctions extract. Aptos executes. Same fee. Sixty milliseconds. Every single time."*

---

## Key Points
- Fee auctions: Economically elegant, practically brutal
- Peak demand = unaffordable for regular users
- Aptos: No auction, arrival-based ordering
- Governance-set flat fees
- ~60ms blocks = higher throughput, not higher prices
