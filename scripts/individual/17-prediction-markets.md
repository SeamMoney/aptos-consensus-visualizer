# Prediction Markets: Why Aptos is the Only Chain That Works

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Block River with high transaction flow + consensus stats showing ~60-100ms block times

## Hook

*"Election night. Fifty million people refreshing Polymarket. The moment results drop, everyone trades at once."*

*"Most chains? They choke. Fees explode. Users rage."*

*"Aptos? Sixty millisecond blocks. Same gas price. No sweat."*

## Script

**[Point to the live block time stats]**

*"Look at this. Real-time Aptos mainnet. Block times hovering around 50 to 100 milliseconds. That's Velociraptr—optimistic proposals that don't wait for confirmation before starting the next block."*

*"While other chains are still finalizing, Aptos has already moved on."*

**[Show Block River under load]**

*"Prediction markets have a brutal problem: demand perfectly correlates with events. Zero to maximum in one second. No gradual scaling. Just chaos."*

*"Solana's fee market breaks. Priority fees spike a thousand X. Regular users get priced out."*

**[Point to parallel execution]**

*"Aptos handles it differently. Block-STM processes all those trades in parallel. Bets on one outcome don't block bets on another—different orderbook sides, no conflict."*

*"And gas fees? Flat. No auction. First come, first served."*

*"Sixty millisecond finality. Fifty thousand TPS headroom. Same price whether you're first or fifty-millionth."*

## Banger

*"Sixty milliseconds. Fifty million traders. Zero fee spikes. That's Aptos."*

## Key Points
- Current block time: ~50-100ms (Velociraptr optimization)
- Block-STM parallelizes different orderbook sides
- No priority fee auction = stable gas prices
- First-come, first-served ordering
- Future: Archon will push to sub-10ms
