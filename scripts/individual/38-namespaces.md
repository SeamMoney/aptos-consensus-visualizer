# Namespaces: Your Own Fast Lane on Aptos

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Multiple isolated lanes with different latencies
**Status:** ⚪ 2026 ROADMAP

---

## Hook

*"What if your dApp had its own dedicated lane on the blockchain? Isolated from congestion. Sub-10 millisecond blocks. Same security as the main chain."*

*"That's Namespaces. Coming 2026."*

---

## Script

**[Show single congested network]**

*"Today, every dApp shares the same network. NFT mint goes viral? Everyone feels it. Memecoin surge? Everyone slows down."*

*"Your prediction market competes with gaming transactions competes with DeFi swaps. One noisy neighbor affects everyone."*

**[Show namespace architecture]**

*"Namespaces create isolated environments within Aptos. Think of them as dedicated express lanes on the Aptos highway."*

*"Each namespace feels like its own network. But they all share one consensus. One security model. No external bridges. No extra trust assumptions."*

**[Show the latency benefits]**

*"Within a single namespace: sub-10 millisecond blocks. That's Archon consensus optimized for your specific traffic."*

*"Cross-namespace transactions? Still fast—under 50 milliseconds. The Aptos Internet routes between namespaces seamlessly."*

**[Show use cases]**

*"Polymarket gets a prediction market namespace. Gaming studio gets a gaming namespace. High-frequency trading gets a trading namespace."*

*"Each optimized for their workload. Isolated from others' congestion. But all connected. All secure. All Aptos."*

## Banger

*"Your own lane. Sub-10 milliseconds. Zero bridge risk. Namespaces make every dApp feel like they own the chain."*
