# Gas Fees Under Load: The Aptos Difference

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Block River or TPS race showing stable performance

## Hook

*"March 2024. Solana memecoin mania. Priority fees exploded—0.000005 SOL to 0.5 SOL."*

*"That's a hundred thousand X increase. In hours."*

*"Meanwhile, Aptos blocks kept landing every 60 milliseconds. Same gas. Same speed."*

## Script

**[Show the contrast]**

*"Sui during high-demand NFT mints? Gas prices surge. Fee auctions everywhere."*

*"Ethereum L1 during a hyped drop? Hundred-dollar swaps. Unusable."*

*"Every chain with a fee auction has the same problem: when demand spikes, prices spike. The network works—but only for whales."*

**[Point to Aptos metrics]**

*"Now look at Aptos. No priority auction. No fee bidding wars."*

*"Transactions order by arrival. First come, first served. The gas price is set by governance, not real-time panic."*

**[Show throughput handling load]**

*"When demand spikes, Aptos doesn't raise prices. It raises throughput."*

*"Block-STM parallelizes the load. Quorum Store absorbs the burst. 50 to 100 millisecond blocks, every time."*

*"Your transaction costs the same whether you're the only user—or one of ten million."*

## Banger

*"Solana spikes. Sui surges. Aptos stays steady. Sixty milliseconds. Every time."*

## Key Points
- Solana: 100,000x fee spike during memecoin mania
- Aptos: No priority fee auction
- Transaction ordering by arrival time, not payment
- Gas price set by governance
- ~60ms blocks maintained under load
