## Hook

*"Crypto is hostile to retail. Seed phrases. Gas wars. Front-running. Complicated wallets."*

*"Aptos flips it. Onboard in one click. Never get front-run. Same fees as everyone else."*

---

## Script

**[Onboarding Problem → Solution]**

*"Problem: Onboarding sucks. Download wallet, write 24 words, pray you don't lose them."*

*"Aptos solution: Keyless Accounts. Sign in with Google. Done. No seed phrase. No wallet app. Live today."*

*"Or X-Chain Accounts. Already have MetaMask? Use it on Aptos. No new keys."*

**[Fee Problem → Solution]**

*"Problem: Gas wars. Whenever something gets popular, fees spike. Regular users get priced out."*

*"Aptos solution: Flat fees. Governance-set, not auction-driven. Same price during memecoin mania as a quiet Tuesday."*

*"Your $50 trade costs the same as a whale's million dollar move. Live today."*

**[Fairness Problem → Solution]**

*"Problem: Front-running. Bots see your trade, jump ahead, profit off your slippage."*

*"Aptos solution: Multi-layer protection."*

*"Transaction shuffling makes your position unpredictable. Live today."*

*"Encrypted mempool hides your trade until execution. Coming soon."*

*"Arrival-based ordering means first come, first served. No paying for priority."*

**[Speed + Confidence]**

*"And it's fast. Sixty milliseconds to confirmation. You click, it's done. No 'pending' anxiety."*

*"True finality. No 'wait for more blocks.' Final means final."*

**[The Vision]**

*"Retail users shouldn't need to understand MEV to trade safely. They shouldn't pay more because whales are active. They shouldn't memorize 24 words."*

*"Aptos makes blockchain invisible. Just the app. Just the trade. Just fair."*

## Banger
