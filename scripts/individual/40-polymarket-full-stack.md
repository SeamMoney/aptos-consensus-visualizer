**[Show the user journey]**

*"You open Polymarket. Election night. You want to bet."*

**[Layer 1: Onboarding - Keyless]**

*"First: Onboarding. Sign in with Google. That's it. Keyless Accounts create your wallet instantly. No seed phrase. No app download. Live today."*

**[Layer 2: Trade Submission - Encrypted Mempool]**

*"You place your bet. The transaction enters an encrypted mempool. Your trade intent? Hidden. Market makers can't see it. Can't front-run it. Can't sandwich it."*

*"Coming soon—first L1 with native encrypted mempool."*

**[Layer 3: Order Shuffling - Transaction Shuffling]**

*"Even within the block, transactions get shuffled. Bots can't predict final position. Your trade executes fairly. Live today."*

**[Layer 4: Position Privacy - Confidential Transactions]**

*"Your position size? Encrypted. Whales can't be detected and targeted. Confidential transactions hide the amounts while proving validity."*

*"Live on devnet. Mainnet coming."*

**[Layer 5: Parallel Processing - Orderless Transactions]**

*"Election gets called. Forty-seven million bets close at once. Orderless transactions process them in parallel. No queue. No bottleneck."*

*"Live on testnet."*

**[Layer 6: Stable Execution - Flat Fees]**

*"The surge hits. On other chains, fees spike a thousand X. On Aptos? Same gas as Sunday morning. Sixty millisecond blocks. No auction. Live today."*

**[Layer 7: Auto Settlement - Event-Driven]**

*"Oracle confirms the winner. Event-driven transactions fire automatically. Positions settle without keepers, without delay, without MEV extraction."*

*"Coming soon."*

**[Layer 8: Dedicated Lane - Namespaces]**

*"And in 2026? Polymarket gets its own namespace. Sub-10 millisecond blocks. Isolated from other traffic. Same security."*
