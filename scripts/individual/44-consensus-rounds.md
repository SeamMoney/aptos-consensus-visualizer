# Consensus Rounds: How Fast Can Validators Agree?

**Duration:** ~45-60 seconds  
**Animation:** Consensus rounds chart
**Status:** 🟢 LIVE

## Hook

*"Finality is just consensus speed measured in rounds."*

---

## Script

**[Show the rounds chart climbing and dipping]**

*"Each point here is a consensus round — a full propose‑vote‑commit loop."*

*"More rounds per second means blocks finalize faster. Fewer rounds means the network is waiting on votes or bandwidth."*

**[Point to stable periods]**

*"When the line is smooth, the network is in rhythm. When it stutters, you can see the exact moment consensus slowed."*

*"This is why Aptos optimizations matter — Raptr cuts hops, Velociraptr overlaps them, and Zaptos pipelines the whole flow."*

## Banger

*"Consensus is a clock. This chart shows how fast it ticks."*

## Key Points
- Rounds per second correlate to finality speed
- Smooth lines mean healthy, synchronized validators
- Spikes and dips reveal real network events
- Optimizations show up immediately on this chart
