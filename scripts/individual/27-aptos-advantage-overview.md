# The Aptos Advantage: Full Summary

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Animation:** Multiple visualizations or TPS race

---

## Hook

*"The blockchain trilemma says pick two: security, decentralization, or speed."*

*"Aptos picked all three. Sixty milliseconds at a time."*

---

## Script

**[Rapid-fire through features]**

*"Velociraptr—sixty millisecond blocks on mainnet right now. Optimistic proposals that don't wait."*

*"Block-STM—8 to 16x parallel speedup. Transactions that don't touch each other don't wait for each other."*

*"Loader V2—60% faster blocks from smart caching. Load once, execute forever."*

*"Zaptos—four blocks in flight simultaneously. No idle hardware. No wasted cycles."*

*"Quorum Store—data disseminates before consensus. No leader bottleneck."*

*"Flat fees—no auction, no spikes. Same price at peak as at idle."*

**[Show the compound effect]**

*"Each optimization compounds. Parallel execution TIMES pipeline parallelism TIMES caching."*

*"And with Archon coming? Sub-10 millisecond blocks. That's faster than blinking."*

**[Land the finish]**

*"This isn't one breakthrough. It's systematic engineering across every layer."*

*"Fastest finality. Most parallel execution. Most advanced research. All three."*

## Banger

*"Sixty milliseconds today. Ten tomorrow. Other chains choose. Aptos conquers all three."*
